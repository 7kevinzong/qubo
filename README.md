# qubo

## Setup Instructions

Project QUBO currently only supports Ubuntu 14.04.  Any other platforms may not (and probably will not) work correctly.

### Compilation

First of all, install all the dependencies in the project by running the handy installation script:
```sh
bash scripts/install_dependencies.bash
```

source the setup script which SHOULD be at the path below, but if you put it somewhere else you'll have to find it yourself. You're going to want to add the source command to your .bashrc file or equivalent, as you'll have to source it every time 

```sh
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
```

We use a system called catkin as our build system. to use it cd into qubo/ and call

```sh
catkin_make
```

We've been told that catkin_make is identical to the following commands
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
but we've found differences in the files generated by each, stick with using catkin_make!

### Optional Steps

##### To run all the unit/integration tests:
From the build directory:
```sh
make run_tests
```

### Using gdb

In the lm4tools repository downloaded earlier, there is a tool called "lmicdi". I will assume that you have compiled this tool and added it to your path. To run gdb, do

```sh
> lmicdi &
> arm-none-eabi-gdb blinky.axf
(gdb) target remote :7777
```

Specifing blinky.axf is not nessasary, but it will tell gdb to load debuging symbols from it. Adding -ggdb to the CFLAGS used to compile the program will give gdb more debug information.
